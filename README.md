# Api-Exercise
This was a project during year 4 at NTI Södertörn where we were to use 3 diffrent api's. One for buss & train departure times, one for current weather & date and lastly one for the current top 5 popular books (NY-Times api)

## Requirements
One page with said 3 api's displaying their individual information with the selected location being Huddinge/Flemmingsberg. Then another page that has the dates and days of the current week
